## Unity Quirks

This project was created to show sample solutions to a few major problems with the Unity game engine:
 * Audio in split-screen games
 * Wind for custom terrain trees
 * Loading and saving game settings

This project was designed to compliment the blog post ["The Many Quirks of Unity"](https://loonycode.wordpress.com/2024/12/19/the-many-quirks-of-unity/) - give it a read!

Each folder includes a Unity scene showcasing a solution to one of these problems, as well as a readme file describing the solution.

The project was designed in Unity 6 (6000.0.26f1), so any version after that should work.
