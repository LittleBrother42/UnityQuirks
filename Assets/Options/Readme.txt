This sample shows various methods to load and save game settings in Unity. The sample scene includes three components, each of which will save when set and will be loaded when the application is started. The three components are as follows:

Custom text box: This is a pretty straightforward block of text that, when edited, saves the contents to a file using standard .NET system libraries. When the application is started, the file will be read (if it exists) and the text box will be populated with its content. The file is stored in the game's persistent data path, as described in this link: https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Application-persistentDataPath.html.

Input rebinding: The "Space Bar to Submit" checkbox allows you to choose which keyboard button to use to select the highlighted UI component. If this is unchecked, you can use Enter to check it; if it's checked, you'll have to use the Space Bar instead. The input bindings are saved using Unity's PlayerPrefs system. Note that the binding code is very hacky and should definitely not be used in production; input binding is generally much more complex than just passing in a predefined string describing the new input. Read more about it here: https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.11/manual/ActionBindings.html.

Graphics: The "High Quality" checkbox allows you to alternate between higher quality and lower quality graphics. The most obvious differences are shadows, anti-aliasing (look around the edges of shapes) and bloom (look at the brighter parts of the screen). There are two parts to this: updating the overall quality settings using QualitySettings.SetQualityLevel, and updating the bloom post-processing effect by modifying the postProcessingVolumeProfile. Note that the quality level saves automatically, but post-processing effects do not, so you'll have to modify the latter on startup to match your desired settings. (Note that because the scene is very simple and low-quality mode has VSync disabled, so you're likely to experience "coil whine" in low-quality mode. So don't panic if your GPU starts making some weird noises!)
